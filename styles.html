<br><center> <img class="rounded-image" src="garba.webp" alt="Circle Image"> </center> <h3> <center> Type 1: Garba </center> </h3>
<p> <center>A traditional Indian folk dance that honors, worships, and celebrates <br> the feminine form of divinity.
   The dance is traditionally performed during the festival of Navratri. <br> 
   It is performed majorly in the state of Gujarat.
   <br>  The dance originated in villages of Gujarat where the entire community participated.Garba dances celebrate fertility, 
   <br> honour womanhood, and pay respect to any of an array of mother goddesses. In Gujarat the dances customarily mark 
  <br> a girl’s first menstrual cycle and, later, her imminent marriage. Garba dancing also takes place during the nine-day Navratri festival, 
    <br> held annually during the Hindu month of Ashvina (September–October). Although men may participate on some occasions, women are the typical performers of garba.

<h3> <center> Type 2: Kathak </center></h3>
<p> <center> Kathak is a prominent ancient Indian classical dance and is thought to have started from the wandering bards of North India known as Kathakars, meaning storytellers.
  <br>  These Kathakars travelled and conveyed stories by means of music, dance and songs akin to the early Greek theatre.
<br> Kathak is indigenous to northern India and developed under the influence of both Hindu and Muslim cultures. 
<br> Kathak is characterized by intricate footwork and precise rhythmic patterns that the dancer articulates by controlling 
<br> about 100 ankle bells. It takes its movements from life, stylizes them, and adds the complex rhythmic patterns. 
<br> Kathak is danced by both males and females; many of the dances convey moods of love.</center></p>

<h3> <center> Type 4: Bhangra </center></h3>
<p> <center>Bhangra is the traditional dance of Punjab. It is native to the Punjabi nation. A long ago, Punjabi-Sikh farmers started to use different farming activities 
  <br> to create a dance form to celebrate food-growing, harvesting and relationship to the land, which later they starting calling Bhangra.
  <br> The term bhangra originally designated a particular dance performed by Sikh and Muslim men in the farming districts of the Punjab region of South Asia. 
  <br> The dance was associated primarily with the spring harvest festival Baisakhi, and it is from one of the major products of the harvest—bhang
  <br>  (hemp)—that bhangra drew its name. In a typical performance, several dancers executed vigorous kicks,
  <br>  leaps, and bends of the body to the accompaniment of short songs called boliyan and, most significantly, to the beat of a dhol (double-headed drum). </center></p>
